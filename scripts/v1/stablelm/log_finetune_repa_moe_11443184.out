Warning: The cache directory for DeepSpeed Triton autotune, /home/li309/.triton/autotune, appears to be on an NFS system. While this is generally acceptable, if you experience slowdowns or hanging when DeepSpeed exits, it is recommended to set the TRITON_CACHE_DIR environment variable to a non-NFS path.
